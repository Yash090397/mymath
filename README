Description:
	I have implemented all functions of the math library in C. I have handled almost all types of cases and tried to return the closest values as the real math library in C. I have also handled all the cases of NaN, INFINTIY, HUGE_VAL , etc.I have tried to optimise some of the codes for better time complexity.
	I have tried to induce maximum accuracy as far as the return values are concerned but i have not been succesful to do so in all the functions. 
	I have written a test file that reads from a tab separated txt file and checks if for a given function and value the values of math.c & mymath.c match or not.
